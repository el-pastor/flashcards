Divide and conquer	General term for an algorithm based on recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems
Merge sort, mergesort	The oldest divide and conquer sorting method, discovered by John von Neumann in 1945
Selection, Insertion, Bubble sort	An example of a simple sorting method
log n	The number of successive halving of subarrays required to reduce an array of length n to n arrays of length 1
n-1	The maximum number of comparisons required when merging two sorted arrays each of length n/2 into a single array of length n
(n-1) log n, n log n	Starting with n arrays of length 1, the approximate maximum number of comparisons required when repeatedly merging pairs of sorted arrays into a single sorted array of length n
n log n	The lower bound on the number of operations required to sort n numbers using merge sort
n^2, n squared	The lower bound on the number of operations required to sort n numbers using a simple sorting method
2^j	The number of sub-problems, if n numbers are subjected to j recursive sub-divisions	
O(f(n))	In general, given a function T(n) and some simplified function f(n), then if the highest term of T(n) is ≤ the highest term of f(n), then T(n) is 
Ω(f(n)), omega(f(n))	In general, given a function T(n) and some simplified function f(n), then if the highest term of T(n) ≥ the highest term of f(n), then T(n) is 
Θ(f(n)), theta(f(n))	In general, given a function T(n) and some simplified function f(n), then if the highest term of T(n) is equal to the highest term of f(n), then T(n) is
Inversion	In an array, a pair of values at different array indices that are out of order
n choose 2, n ! 2, n(n-1)/2	In an array of length n, the greatest number of possible inversions
left	In an array of length n, an inversion of numbers at index i,j where i, j ≤ n/2
right	In an array of length n, an inversion of numbers at index i,j where i, j > n/2
split	In an array of length n, an inversion of numbers at index i,j where i ≤ n/2 < j
n^3, n cubed	The lower bound on the number of operations required to multiply two n × n matrices in the conventional way
Strassen	The author of an algorithm discovered in 1969 that improves on the lower bound for multiplying two n × n matrices
	WEEK 2
O(n log n)	On average, QuickSort requires how many operations
Memory	Compared to MergeSort, QuickSort requires much less
Pivot	QuickSort requires one element in an array to act as a
Partition
