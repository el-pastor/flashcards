Divide and conquer	general term for an algorithm based on recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems
Merge sort, mergesort	The oldest divide and conquer sorting method, dscovered by John von Neumann in 1945
Selection, Insertion, Bubble sort	An example of a simple sorting method
n log n	The lower bound on the number of operations required to sort n numbers using merge sort
n^2, n squared	The lower bound on the number of operations required to sort n numbers using a simple sorting method
2^j	The number of sub-problems, if n numbers are subjected to j recursive sub-divisions
n/2^j	The size of each sub-problem, if n numbers are subjected to j recursive sub-divisions	
O(f(n))	In general, given a function T(n) and some simplified function f(n), then if the highest term of T(n) is less than or equal to the highest term of f(n), T(n) is 
Ω(f(n)), omega(f(n))	In general, given a function T(n) and some simplified function f(n), then if the highest term of T(n) is grater than or equal to the highest term of f(n), T(n) is 
Θ(f(n)), theta(f(n))	In general, given a function T(n) and some simplified function f(n), then if the highest term of T(n) is equal to the highest term of f(n), T(n) is
