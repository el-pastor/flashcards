Markov Decision Process, MDP	A single-agent stochastic game with a finite set of states and actions, a set of probabilities of an action leading from one state to another, and a set of expected rewards for each transition
Average reward	In a repeated game, a player's total aggregate payoff divided by the number of repetitions of the game
Discount factor	In a repeated game, the rate at which the value to a player of successive payoffs is sustained, due to uncertainty about when the game might finish or other factors
Learning	The method applied by an agent to adapt its behaviour in a repeated game
Fictitious play	A form of learning, where an agent starts with assumptions about their opponents' strategies and updates those assumptions in response to each round of play
Nash equilibrium	If the empirical distribution of each player's strategies converges in fictitious play, then it converges to a

tit for tat	A strategy where a player co-operates by default, but then if met with defection will in the next game ignore the other player's action and defect before returning to cooperation
