ℝ
ℝⁿ	the set of all ordered n-tuples
ℝ² = { (x₁, x₂) | x₁, x₂ ∈ ℝ }	the set of all 2-tuples

{ x ∈ ℝ : x > 0 }

Vector 	has a magnitude and direction

A vector in ℝⁿ	an ordered list of n real numbers

scalar multiple
zero vector

y = mx + c works well in two dimensions, but vector representation works well in any number of dimansions

parametrisation of a line that goes through two points
vector in standard form starts at the origin
parametric equation

linear combinations
